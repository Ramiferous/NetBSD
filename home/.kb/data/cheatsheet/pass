## Set up pass

First make sure you have pinentry-curses enabled in your gpg-agent.conf (or deleted it to start blank)
Then, from tty:

$ gpg2 --full-gen-key
Choose default
Choose passphrase
Copy GPG key to clipboard, you'll need it to run Pass the first time.

If you forgot to copy it, dont worry. Run:
$ gpg2 --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
The key will be on the 'sec' line, after the first forward slash.

Then run:
$pass init "your gpg2 key"

# To fix the " gpg: WARNING: unsafe permissions on homedir '/home/path/to/user/.gnupg' " error
# Make sure that the .gnupg directory and its contents is accessibile by your user.
$ chown -R $(whoami) ~/.gnupg/

# Also correct the permissions and access rights on the directory
$ chmod 600 ~/.gnupg/*
$ chmod 700 ~/.gnupg

Usage:

Go to lastpass.com and sign in. Next click on "More Options" bottom left hand
corner. Then click "Advanced" and then "Export". After filling in
your details again, copy the text and save it somewhere on your disk. Make sure
you copy the whole thing, and resist the temptation to "Save Page As" - the
script doesn't like HTML.

Fire up a terminal and run the script, passing the file you saved as an argument.
It should look something like this:

$ ./lastpass2pass.rb path/to/passwords_file.csv

Obviously for this to work you need ruby installed ;)
$ doas pkgin install ruby

You may find that due to some passwords being in seperate/categorised folders that passmenu is slow af and doesn't display correctly. Just go into your .passwordstore folder and move all the .gpg's into the main folder.
Once it's all set up you can uninstall ruby if you want.

Set up PASSMENU: 
https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/contrib/dmenu/passmenu
Just put this script in ~/.config/spectrwm/ and make it executable.

## Pinentry program
Set this in ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

For gtk2:
pinentry-program /usr/pkg/bin/pinentry-gtk-2
(remember that you'll have to install it first)

For pinentry-dmenu:
pinentry-program /usr/pkg/bin/pinentry-dmenu

Download pinentry-dmenu and either install using the MakeFile or just simply place it in /usr/pkg/bin/ and make it executable. Then put pinentry-dmenu.conf in ~/.gnupg/

While your at it, also add this to gpg-agent.conf:
allow-loopback-pinentry
