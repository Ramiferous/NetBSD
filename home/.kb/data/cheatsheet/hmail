## Senting email with hairloom-mailx
$ hmail -A gmail email@xyz.com

To send attachments:
~@ /path/to/attachment

## Reading mail
Unfortunatly hmail opens at the bottom of your inbox showing you the oldest messages.... (until I figure out how to change this that is). 

# Type 'headers' from within a buffer to get back to your inbox

# to page down:
& z

to read a spesific message just type its four digit id number eg.
& 1087

(A) ?
(F) no idea -- I assume flaged?
(U) Unread

# to delete a message 
& delete 1087

# to download attachments:
& write 1087 sometitle

Enter filename for part 1 (text/plain): email.txt
Enter filename for part 2 (image/jpeg): file.jpg
Enter filename for part 2 (image/png): file.png

# The attachments will be saved to the home directory, I havent yet figured out how to specify where to save the attachments or how to rename them when saving. 

# The 'sometitle' is an empty file but it is necesary to type something otherwise nothing is downloaded.
