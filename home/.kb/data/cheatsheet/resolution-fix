## Adding undetected resolutions

Due to buggy hardware or drivers, your monitor's correct resolutions may not always be detected by xrandr. For example, the EDID data block queried from the monitor may be incorrect. However, we can add the desired resolutions to xrandr. Also, this same procedure can be used to add refresh rates you know are supported, but not enabled by your driver.

First we run gtf or cvt to get the Modeline for the resolution we want:

$ cvt 1920 1080
# 1920x1080 59.96 Hz (CVT 2.07M9) hsync: 67.16 kHz; pclk: 173.00 MHz
Modeline "1920x1080_60.00"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync

Then we create a new xrandr mode. Note that the Modeline keyword needs to be ommited.

$ xrandr --newmode "1920x1080_60.00"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync

After creating it we need an extra step to add this new mode to our current output (VGA1). We use just the name of the mode, since the parameters have been set previously.

$ xrandr --addmode Virtual1 1920x1080_60.00
Now we change the resolution of the screen to the one we just added:

$ xrandr --output Virtual1 --mode 1920x1080_60.00



## Permanently adding undetected resolutions
## Once a suitable resolution is found using xrandr, the mode can be permanently added by creating an entry in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/:

/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.conf
Section "Monitor"
    Identifier "VGA1"
    Modeline "1280x1024_60.00"  109.00  1280 1368 1496 1712  1024 1027 1034 1063 -hsync +vsync
    Option "PreferredMode" "1280x1024_60.00"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier "Screen0"
    Monitor "VGA1"
    DefaultDepth 24
    SubSection "Display"
        Modes "1280x1024_60.00"
    EndSubSection
EndSection

Section "Device"
    Identifier "Device0"
    Driver "intel"
EndSection
Replace intel with the right driver, e.g. nvidia. When the X server is restarted, you should be able to set the new resolution.

If this doesn't work for you, try removing the Screen and Device sections and just leaving the Monitor section.
