## Cleaning shit up:
$ rm -r .cache/*

Check also if you find something cached in ~/.local/share and ~/.local/share/applications, remove it.
You can also empty (but dont delete) this file: /var/db/pkgin/pkgin_install-err.log


## Wanting to get a list of installed packages:
$ pkgin list | awk '{print $1}' >list_of_packages
