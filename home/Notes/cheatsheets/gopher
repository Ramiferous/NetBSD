### Nixers Gopher

 > Access my account ?
           
               ssh -i path/to/key account@g.nixers.net
           
           Where "account" is your username.
           
           
           > Add content to my hole ?
           
           A symlink to your hole is availabe in your home directory:
           
               cd ~/public_gopher
           
           By default, all files present in this directory is listed
           by the gopher server. If an index file is present, its content
           is displayed rather than the directory listing.
           
           > Visit my hole ?
           
           Your hole is visible under a directory named after your account
           name. For example:
           
               gopher://g.nixers.net/1/~account/
           
           > Post content to my phlog ?
           
           By sending emails !
           
           Edit ~/.forward and set your real email address. The content of the file
           should ressemble something like this:
           
               "|/usr/local/bin/scribo -b ~/public_gopher/rlog -a you@domain.tld"
           
           Every email sent to <account@g.nixers.net> will create a file in the
           the "rlog" directory with you email content inside it. The post title
           will inherit from the mail subject, as for the file name.
           
           Check forward(5) and scribo(1) for further information.
